# Crypto Volatility Regimes & Dependence
Volatility modeling, dependence and regime detection in cryptocurrency markets.

## Overview

This repository contains applied quantitative research on cryptocurrency markets,
focused on volatility modeling, dynamic dependence, and regime detection.

The goal is to provide **research-grade but practical analyses** that can be reused
for market monitoring, risk assessment, and signal validation.

Typical use cases include:
- protocol analytics
- risk monitoring
- research validation
- custom market studies for DAOs or funds
  

## Projects

### Project 1 — Volatility & Directional Dynamics (BTC)
- GARCH(1,1) volatility modeling
- Residual diagnostics and regime identification
- Illustrative directional signals during low-volatility regimes

### Project 2 — Rolling Correlation & Portfolio Risk
- Time-varying dependence between BTC and altcoins
- Rolling correlations, volatility and VaR
- Portfolio-level risk interpretation

### Project 3 — DCC-GARCH Dynamic Dependence
- Multivariate GARCH with dynamic conditional correlations
- Contagion analysis during BTC shocks
- Econometric framework (Engle, 2002)

## Tools & Stack
- R, tidyverse, quantmod
- rugarch, rmgarch
- Financial econometrics & time series analysis

## Notes
This work is intended for **research, analytics, and validation purposes**.
It is not presented as a trading strategy.


## Custom Research

This framework can be adapted to:
- specific tokens or ecosystems
- alternative timeframes
- volatility regimes & event studies
- correlation and contagion analysis

Selected components of this framework can be adapted for 
custom research notes, diagnostics or exploratory studies.
